# Content Analysis Rules

## Spelling
Always use "Glossi" (not "Glossy").

## Audio Workflow
When processing dropped audio files:
1. **Transcription**: Use OpenAI Whisper API to convert speech to text
2. **Analysis**: Send transcript to Claude to summarize and extract key takeaways
3. **Progress**: Show progress bar during upload and processing
4. **Destination**: Present user with choice to save to "Thoughts" or "Key Talking Points"

## Text/PDF/Image Workflow
When processing dropped text, PDF, or image files:
1. **Analysis**: Use Claude (vision for images) to analyze and summarize
2. **Format**: Extract TITLE, SUMMARY, and KEY POINTS
3. **Destination**: Present user with choice to save to "Thoughts" or "Key Talking Points"

## Analysis Output Format
Claude should return analysis in this format:
```
TITLE: [brief descriptive title, max 8 words]
SUMMARY: [1-2 sentence summary]
KEY POINTS:
- [key point 1]
- [key point 2]
- [key point 3 if applicable]
```

## User Experience
- Show progress bar with percentage during long operations
- Display real upload progress (0-50%) then simulated processing progress (50-95%)
- Thoughts are collapsible by default, showing only the title
- Users can edit analysis text inline after saving
