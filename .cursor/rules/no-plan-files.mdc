# No Plan or Summary Files

NEVER create markdown files for plans, summaries, reports, checklists, or logs. This includes files in a `docs/` folder or any standalone `.md` files used to document what was done.

- Do NOT create files like `SUMMARY.md`, `UPDATE_LOG.md`, `FINAL_STATUS.md`, `TESTING_GUIDE.md`, etc.
- Keep all plans, summaries, and status updates in the chat conversation only.
- The only exceptions are `README.md` and files the user explicitly asks you to create.
